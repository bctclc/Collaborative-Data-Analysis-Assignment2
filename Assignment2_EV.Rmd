Research Questions:
1. Who are the potential buyers of EVs? 
2. What makes people buy or not buy EVs? 
(Identify potential buyers of EV in UK. Differentiated targeting strategies for EV.)

## Background

As a part of the efforts to cope with the climate change, countries have been trying to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
Considering the fact that the large portion of GHG emission is attributed to road traffic [@EC_climate], reducing the emission from vehicles is an important issue for many industrialized countries.

Several types of low emission vehicles have been invented and released into the world as listed below [@USDOE].

* Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), which use both a conventional inner combustion engine (e.g. gasoline engine) and an electric motor, are the early generation of the low emission vehicles. 
HEVs store electric powers in a battery from braking and the inner combustion engine, which are normally lost in conventional vehicles. 
Thus, HEVs have better fuel efficiency and less emission compared to the conventional vehicles.

* Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are the improved version of HEVs. 
PHEVs have a smaller inner combustion engine and more powerful batteries that can be charged by plugging into charging infrastructures, as well as the energy captured from braking and the inner combustion engine. 
Thus, PHEVs have further better fuel efficiency and less emission compared to HEVs.

* Electric Vehicles (EVs) are the most recent generation of the low emission vehicles, which powered only by an electric motor. 
The batteries that drive the motors are charged by plugging into charging infrastructures. 
Because EVs do not use inner combustion engines at all, they make no emission when they drive.

From the environmental point of view, EVs are the ideal type of vehicles. 
However, because of many reasons, the adoption rates of EVs are not as high as the desirable level. 
One of the biggest reasons is the costs. 
Although some articles report that EVs are cheaper than conventional vehicles in long-term thanks to no fuel costs [e.g. @Herron2015web], people tend to refrain from buying EVs because of the high purchase prices.
Also, current technical standards such as battery capacities (maximum driving distance with one-time charging) are also pointed out to be an obstacle to the widespread EV adoption [@lieven2011will].
 
Aiming to promote EVs, governments have been taking various kinds of means such as financial incentives and R&D grants. 
In order to maximize the performance of those governments' efforts, and thus to accelerate EV adoption, this study aims to **identify the characteristics of the potential EV buyers**, and **reasons that makes those potential buyers to choose EVs over conventional vehicles**.


## Literature Review
### to be deleted: Past topics: factors influencing the choice (1, 3, 4, 6) -> what makes people buy or not buy EVs (1,3); policies to promote the adoption (2, 5)
to be deleted: Literature review:
1.	Why EV not adopted? US. More knowledge -> more adoption 
2.	Evaluation of US tax credit policy. Suggest a differentiated benefit policy.
3.	Motivations of people buying hybrids. UK. Toyota. Principle component analysis. A list of motivations. Environment concerns matter most, self-satisfaction/displaying value rank the second, financial incentives from the government the third, economic benefits the fourth. 
4.	Relationship between adoption of HEVs and socio-economic factors. Finland. The analysis also suggests that the income and education level, the amount of families with children and the average size of the residences are highly interrelated with the amount of HEVs adopted per household in the studied areas.
5.	Different policy options and their efficiency. US by state. Income and age matter. Probably concern for energy security matters too.
6.	Factors influencing EV adoption (country-level characteristics). 


Previous studies have examined various factors that influence consumerfs choice.
At a macro level, the relationship between demographic characteristics and EV adoption has been analyzed. -> Lit 4 (Finland) and Lit 6 (country comparison)
At an individual level, motivations and determinants that affect individual choice are studied. -> 1, 3

In addition, possible policy options to promote EV adoption are also covered by several articles. -> 2, 5
